# PancakeSwap-AI-Sniper-Pool-Bot
Private PancakeSwap/Uniswap Sniper Bot in multiple OS and configurations

We decided to build PancakeSwap-AI-Sniper-Pool-Bot different, 100% in Python & FAST. 
By avoiding web interfaces & Metamask and directly with Ethereum & EVM Nodes and route your orders  faster than any of the web based platforms. This created a more advanced ecosystem that allows tokens to be added at a moments notice as well as leaving the strategy possibilities endless for third party developers.
Our Bots use a custom wrapper to talk directly with each exchange's smart contracts DIRECTLY,  this enables us to have the fastest through put possible.  We also utilize Web3.py to sign and make calls to these contracts. All of this is done LOCALLY on you machine. We NEVER have access to read your private keys.
